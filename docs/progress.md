```

## Phase 1: Project skeleton (2026-10-01)
- Built: installable `finances` 0.1.0 package, `FIN_` settings, redacting log filter, `fin --version`, `fin doctor`, and tests.
- Deviations from spec (and why): `.gitignore` also ignores `data/samples/`, uppercase statement extensions, and `*.sqlite3`, so real exports stay untracked even if Git's ignore matching is case-sensitive. Ruff format excludes `docs/` so `ruff format --check .` does not rewrite phase specs.
- Follow-ups / known issues: tests now live in `tests/unit/` (`test_config.py`, `test_log.py`) and `tests/e2e/` (`test_cli.py`), matching `docs/testing.md`.

## Phase 2a: Coverage gate and shared fixture (2026-10-12)
- Built: pyproject.toml with pytest-cov>=5 dependency, tests/conftest.py with tmp_settings fixture, and tests/unit/test_diagnostics.py with five tests. TOTAL coverage: 93.70%.
- Deviations from spec (and why): None
- Follow-ups / known issues: None

## Phase 2b: Tests for Phase 1 gaps (2026-10-12)
- Built: three tests for untested Phase 1 branches (`mask_url` with a port, `mask_url` with an IPv6 host, `fin doctor` exit code 1), and the final newline of `pyproject.toml`. 16 tests pass. TOTAL coverage: 98.43%.
- Deviations from spec (and why): None
- Follow-ups / known issues: None

## Phase 2c: format_cents (2026-10-12)
- Built: `format_cents` in `src/finances/domain/money.py`, and `tests/unit/test_money.py`. 30 tests pass. `money.py` coverage: 100%.
- Deviations from spec (and why): None

- Deviations from spec (and why): None
- Follow-ups / known issues: None

## Phase 2f: validate_last4 (2026-10-12)

- Follow-ups / known issues: None

## Phase 2h: get_engine and session_scope (2026-10-12)
- Built: `get_engine` and `session_scope` in `src/finances/db/engine.py`; `tests/integration/test_engine.py`. 191 tests pass. `engine.py` coverage: 100%.
- Deviations from spec (and why): None
- Follow-ups / known issues: None

## Phase 2i: the first migration (2026-10-12)
- Built: Alembic dependency; `src/finances/db/migrations/env.py`; migration `0001` creating the `accounts` table; `tests/integration/test_migrations.py`. 208 tests pass.
- Deviations from spec (and why): None
- Follow-ups / known issues: None

## Phase 2j: running migrations from code (2026-10-12)

## Phase 2l: find_accounts_by_last4 and list_accounts (2026-10-13)
- Built: `find_accounts_by_last4` and `list_accounts` in `src/finances/db/repositories.py`, with their tests in `tests/integration/test_repositories.py`. 282 tests pass. `repositories.py` coverage: 100%.
- Deviations from spec (and why): None
- Follow-ups / known issues: None

## Phase 2m: the database and account commands (2026-10-13)
- Built: `fin db upgrade` in `src/finances/cli/db.py`; `fin accounts add` and `fin accounts list` in `src/finances/cli/accounts.py`; the "Database schema" check in `src/finances/diagnostics.py`; `tests/e2e/test_cli_accounts.py` and updated CLI and diagnostics tests. 315 tests pass. `finances.cli` and `diagnostics.py` coverage: 100%.
- Deviations from spec (and why): None
- Follow-ups / known issues: None

## Phase 3a: the statement model and parsing helpers (2026-10-13)
- Built: `StatementError`, `Section`, `StatementLine`, and `ParsedStatement` in `src/finances/ingest/statement.py`; `collapse_ws`, `parse_amount`, `infer_year`, and `parse_month_day` in `src/finances/ingest/parsers/helpers.py`; `tests/unit/test_statement.py` and `tests/unit/test_parser_helpers.py`. 450 tests pass. `finances.ingest` coverage: 100%.
- Deviations from spec (and why): None
- Follow-ups / known issues: None

## Phase 3b: statement checks and reading (2026-10-13)
- Built: `ReconcileResult` and `reconcile` in `src/finances/ingest/reconcile.py`; `fingerprint_lines` in `src/finances/ingest/dedup.py`; `extract_pages` in `src/finances/ingest/pdf_text.py`; `StatementParser`, `register`, `unregister`, `registered_parsers`, and `detect_parser` in `src/finances/ingest/parsers/__init__.py`; `pypdf` dependency; PDF and registry fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`; tests in `tests/unit/test_reconcile.py`, `tests/unit/test_dedup.py`, `tests/unit/test_pdf_text.py`, and `tests/unit/test_parser_registry.py`. 516 tests pass. `finances.ingest` coverage: 100%.
- Deviations from spec (and why): The parser registry is a dict keyed by parser name, which keeps registration order. No private helpers.
- Follow-ups / known issues: None

## Phase 3c: storing and importing statements (2026-10-13)
- Built: `DataSource`, `Statement`, `NewTransaction`, `Transaction`, and `BalanceSnapshot` in `src/finances/domain/models.py`; `StatementRow`, `TransactionRow`, `BalanceSnapshotRow`, and their converters in `src/finances/db/orm.py`; migration `0002_statements`; eight repository functions in `src/finances/db/repositories.py`; `ImportStatus`, `StatementImportResult`, `import_statement`, and `import_folder` in `src/finances/ingest/service.py`; the fake-bank fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`; `tests/integration/test_migration_0002.py`, `tests/unit/test_statement_models.py`, `tests/unit/test_statement_orm.py`, `tests/integration/test_statement_repositories.py`, and `tests/integration/test_import_service.py`. 590 tests pass. `finances.ingest`, `finances.db`, and `finances.domain` coverage: 100%.
- Deviations from spec (and why): `import_statement` is one function with private helpers `_match_account`, `_reconcile_message`, and `_new_transaction`. Converters share `_as_utc`, and the three timestamps share `_utc_now`. `existing_fingerprints` asks about 500 fingerprints per query. No other public names.
- Follow-ups / known issues: None
